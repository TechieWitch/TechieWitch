- 👋 Hi, I’m @TechieWitch, or just Claire is fine.
- 👀 I’m interested in game engine development, but not necessarily for games.  I've dabbled in code since high school; QuickBasic and HTML. In college I did some ActionScript for animation and web design.  But also some scripting code with Unreal 3 as well.  I've tinkered with Unity a long time ago and see all the things it's AR and VR development has gotten into so I'm hoping to dive into that in the future.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C# through SoloLearn because of the Unity engine.  After that I'll probably expand to Python, but really wanna tackle Kotlin in the long run for some mobile development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to network and work on a few projects for career development and job placement
- 📫 You can reach me through this profile for now, as I'm just getting used to GitHub.
